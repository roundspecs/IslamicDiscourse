# Islamic Discourse
This is a terminal based debate notebook of some sort, where you play as both the interlocutors, and document arguments for and against Islam.

## How to run:
1. Navigate to the directory:
    ```ps
    cd IslamicDiscourse
    ```
2. Run the following command to start the discourse:
    ```ps
    python3 .
    ```

# Purpose
The main goal of this project is to serve as a educational resource for both Muslims and Non-muslims, interested in learning about both sides of the debate

# Motivation
My motivation for creating this projects stems from my personal journey to Islam, marked by cycles of doubt, learning and occasional forgetfulness. Each question about my faith led me to a discovery, only for the answers to sometimes fade due to my forgetfulness, prompting a need to relearn them.

# How it works
There are two interlocutors, the apologist and the inquirer. The inquirer asks questions and the apologist tries to answer them.
